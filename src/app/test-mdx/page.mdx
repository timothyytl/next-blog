## Welcome to my MDX page!

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: ** Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in _when_ it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Here are some code snippets:

```
export function Component() {
    return (
        <p> Component Test </p>
    )
}

```
